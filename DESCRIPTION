Description: This package builds on the Epimods framework which facilitates 
    finding weighted subnetworks ("modules") on Illumina Infinium 27k 
    arrays using the SpinGlass algorithm, as implemented in the 
    iGraph package. We have created a class of gene centric annotations
    associated with p-values and effect sizes and scores from any 
    researchers prior statistical results to find functional modules.
