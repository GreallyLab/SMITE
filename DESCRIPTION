Description: This package builds on the Epimods framework which facilitates 
             finding weighted subnetworks ("modules") on Illumina Infinium 27k 
             arrays using the SpinGlass algorithm, as implemented in the 
             iGraph package. We have created a class of gene centric annotations
             associated with p-values and effect sizes and scores from any 
             researchers prior statistical results to find functional modules.
