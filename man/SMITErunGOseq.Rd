\title{
Run a GoSeq pathway analysis
}
\description{
This function allows pathway annotation of identified modules.
}
\usage{
SMITErunGOseq(object, p_thresh = 0.05, coverage, type = "reactome")
}

\arguments{
  \item{object}{
An S4 object of class PvalueAnnotation, for which module-finding has already 
been performed
}
  \item{p_thresh}{
A numeric specifying a threshold for signficance of FDR (q-values). DEFAULT is
alpha=0.05
}
  \item{coverage}{
A data.frame that is a bed file (chr  start stop) folowed by a gene name and
a numeric specifying the bias data (e.g. gene length or number of probes related
to gene)}
  \item{type}{
Either "kegg" to run KEGG analysis or "reactome" to run a REACTOME analysis
}
}
\details{
Goseq analysis is useful since it allows you to assess term/pathway enrichment
in a collection of genes, while adjusting for bias data.  Potential bias
can be from aspects like gene length or probe density that influence the
likelihood of finding a particular gene.  For more information please see
the goseq reference.

The function will compare all of the genes within a module to known pathways and
terms to find the terms that are most enriched within a module.  In this way,
this tool allows a reasearch to find a functional importance of a module.

We currently offer KEGG and REACTOME analysis, although additional pathway tools
may be added in the near future.
