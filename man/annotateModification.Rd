\title{
Adding modification data to a PvalueAnnotation
}
\description{
This function is the main "workhorse" function for SMITE because given a 
specific epigenetic modification (e.g. DNA methylation) it will 1) assess
an internal correlation structure and 2) aggregate the modification over all 
intervals associated with a gene in the "makePvalueAnnotation" function.
}
\usage{
annotateModification(pvalue_annotation, mod_data, weight_by = NULL, 
weight_by_method = "Stouffer", mod_included = NULL, mod_corr = TRUE, 
mod_type = "methylation", verbose = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{pvalue_annotation}{
An S4 object of class PvalueAnnotation.
}
  \item{mod_data}{
A dataframe or matrix derived from a bed file with thhe the first three columns
as (chromosome, start, end), column 4 is the effect, and column 5 is the
p-value.
}
  \item{weight_by}{
A vector with named elements specifying how modifications should be weighted 
within an interval.  Must be one of:
    
    "distance"  Use the distance from the gene TSS to weight the p-values
                and the combined effect such that events closer to the
                TSS are weighted more.  Log distances are used.
    
    "pval" 
    "p.value"
    "pvalue"
    "p_val"     (DEFAULT) Do not weight p-values but weight the combined 
                effect such by the signficance of that effect.
     
     ELSE       Do not weight p-values or the combined effect.
    
}
  \item{weight_by_method}{
A character specifying which method should be used to combine 
p-values.  Must be one of:

    "Stouffer"  (DEFAULT)
                Stouffer's method for combing pvalues involves first taking the 
                inverse standard normal
    			CDF transformation of a vector of p-values followed by a 
                weighted sum
				creating a new Z score with a standard normal distribution
	"Fisher"
    "fisher"
    "chisq"
    "chi"
				Fisher's method involves summing the -2ln(p) for each of k p's
                which follows an approximate
				chi square distribution with 2k degrees of freedom
    "Sidak"
    "sidak"
    "minimum"
				Sidak's adjustment is essentially the minimum p-value, with an 
                added transformation to account for
				multiple comparisons.
    "binomial"
				The binomial probability assesses the probability of observing 
                the observed number of p-value below a threshold (alpha=0.05) 
                given the total number of p values and the probability of a 
                false positive.
}
  \item{mod_included}{
A vector of named elements specifying for which intervals in the annotation the
function should find combined scores (e.g. promoters).  If not specified the
assumption is that all type of intervals associated with a gene should be 
included.
}
  \item{mod_corr}{
A logical (TRUE/FALSE) specifying whether a correlation matrix should be
estimated.  The DEFAULT is TRUE.
}
  \item{mod_type}{
A character naming the modification that is being loaded.  The DEFAULT is
"methylation" and any modType string can be used, but will be referred to 
in downstream analysis.  A unique name must be used for each modification that 
is loaded.  When picking a variable modType should also avoid using "_" as it is
used to split column names containing modType.
}
  \item{verbose}{
A logical specifying if the user wants updates about the progress of the
function.
}
