\title{
This function normalizes p-values (Scores) that are otherwise on different 
scales.
}
\description{
This function is a used to rescale compenent scores when distributions
have been altered.  There are two methods available.}
\usage{
normalizePval(object, trans, ref = "expression_pvalue", method = "rescale")
}
\arguments{
  \item{object}{
An S4 object of class p-value annotation
}
  \item{trans}{
A vector specifying a specific Box-cox power transformation to use
}
  \item{ref}{
A string that will be grepped from the names of the loaded expression data or
modification/context pairing.  All scores will be rescaled to match this 
reference's range.  The DEFAULT is expression.
}
  \item{method}{
A string of either

                    "Rescale"   DEFAULT
                    "rescale"
                                Performs a logit transform and rescales all
                                probabilites to the reference's logit 
                                transformed scale, then back-transforms

                    "Box-Cox"
                    "box-cox"
                    "boxcox" 
                    "Boxcox"
                                For each probility vector does a logit transform
                                and then iterates between 0.5 and 0.95 by 0.05
                                to determine the most similar transformation
                                to the logit transformed referece by a Wilcoxon-
                                test
}

\details{
Normalization may not be necessary but should improve some p-values from driving
the majority of downstream scores and modules solely because of the scale of 
their p-values.  All transformations are monotonic and are controlled for by
use of randomization prodecure downstream.
